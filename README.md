# StudentManagementSystem
This project “Student Management System” provides us a simple interface for 
maintenance of student information. It can be used by educational institutes or colleges to 
maintain the records of students easily. Achieving this objective is difficult using a manual 
system as the information is scattered, can be redundant and collecting relevant information 
may be very time consuming. All these problems are solved using this project.
